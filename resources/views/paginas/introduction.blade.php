    <h2>FrontEnd:</h2>
    <p>
        Within web development there are many professions and different disciplines. If you plan to study some web design or development to work in a web page company, we already tell you how to start programming from scratch, without any knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        But today we do not want to tell you where to study frontend, well in part it is like a guide where you can see the different branches and parts of being a frontend developer. What we do want is to recommend how we would start if you want to become front developers or continue learning and advancing in your profession.
    </p>

    <h2>Backend:</h2>
    <p>
        We know that understanding what backend is can be a bit complicated, especially if you do not have programming knowledge. Therefore, in this article we want to explain what backend development or programming is, what a programmer who is dedicated to this area of web development should do, and how you can start studying to work as a backend developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modern websites run a myriad of scripts that work thanks to backend development. The job of the person who specializes as a backend developer is to make sure that the relationship between the servers and the web pages works perfectly.

    <h2>Data Base</h2>
    <p>
        A database is an organized collection of information or structured data, which is typically stored electronically in a computer system. Typically, a database is controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications associated with it, are called a database system, usually abbreviated to simply database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data from the most common types of databases in operation today are typically used as row and column structures in a series of tables to increase the efficiency of data processing and querying. Thus, data can be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled and organized. Most databases use a structured query language (SQL) to write and query data.
